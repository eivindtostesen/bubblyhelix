HOWTO
=====

After having compiled the C++ program (see Readme.txt), and before doing anything else, you may do a test run of the whole Bubblyhelix code.

Choose one of two ways:


Quick way
---------

You can run the shellscript test1.sh from the top level directory of the Bubblyhelix package, by typing the command:

$ ./test1.sh

If you only get a message about creating fasta files, then everything works!



Instructive way
---------------

Or you can type the commands in the test1.sh script yourself, in the order they are listed (copy-paste). test1.sh also contains comment lines that describe what happens in each step and how to see it.

If you only get a message about creating fasta files, then everything works!
